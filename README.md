Practice: Create a to-do list with add/delete functionality.

### 🗓️ Day 5: Lifecycle Hooks

x-init (DOM ready logic)
$nextTick for DOM updates
Using x-ref for element references
Practice: Build a modal that auto-focuses an input field on open.

### 🗓️ Day 6: Alpine Stores (Global State)

Introduction to $store
Creating and using global stores
Updating and reacting to store data
Practice: Theme switcher (dark/light mode) with global state.

### 🗓️ Day 7: Working with Components

Passing props using x-bind
Component reusability
Practice: Build a custom tab system with reusable components.

### 🗓️ Day 8: Forms and Validation

Custom form validation logic
Real-time error messages
Practice: Build a simple login or registration form with validations.

### 🗓️ Day 9: Transitions and Animations

### 🗓️ Day 12: Building a Mini Project

Choose a project:
Modal with form + API
Weather widget
Step-by-step wizard
Combine x-data, x-for, x-model, x-transition, and x-fetch

### 🗓️ Day 13: Debugging & Best Practices

Common issues and how to debug them
Alpine DevTools (if using with browser extensions)
Code organization tips
When to use Alpine.js vs Vue/React
